                        Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three
                        meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat
                        Bunce, and skinny
                         Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox
                        and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
                        they're not dealing
                         with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox would never surrender.
                        But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.
